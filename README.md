# Story Time

## Project Description

An app to connect elderly folks to their grandkids. This project is a solution for General Assembly's Holiday Hackathon, a three day project sprint. The prompt was: How might we leverage technology to reimagine a pre-pandemic social activity and inspire a sense of togetherness? Our team consisted of one UXDI fellow and three SEI fellows.
